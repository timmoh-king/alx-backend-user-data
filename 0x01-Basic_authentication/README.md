## GENERAL

In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rpsPy0M3_FJuCLGNPUbmvg)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of google:**

- What authentication means
- What Base64 is
- How to encode a string in Base64
- What Basic authentication means
- How to send the Authorization header
